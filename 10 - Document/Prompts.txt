I have to create an Expanded use Case for each Use Case of  my Project Use Case Diagram 

Expanded Use Case headings will be

Use Case ID:
Use Case Name:
Actors
Description
Trigger
Precondition
Post Condition
Normal Flow:
Alternate Flow
Includes
Special Requirements
Assumptions
Notes and Issues 


A brief description of these headings is

Preconditions:
These should be non-obvious.
Preconditions state what must ALWAYS be true before you can start the scenario.  This often defines the success of another use case.
Success guarantees state what must be true on successful completion of the use case.  


Normal Flow:

This satisfies the interests of the stakeholders.  You get your groceries, the store gets your money, inventory is reduced, etc.
Steps:
An interaction between actors
Validation (by the system)
State change to the system

Normal Flow will be the as The User does action and system responds according to it 

Alternative Flow:
These include all other possible outcomes, both success and failure.

and The most Important Thing 

Write in UI-Free Style
Most programs are dependent upon a particular user interface.  However, avoid constraining your program too early:
For example:
“The user keys an ID and password into a dialog box and presses the OK button.”
“The user identifies himself to the system.”
The latter allows for biometric ID, keyin, etc.

Essential Style:

Focus on the essence, or basic idea, not the details of implementation
Contrast with concrete style
