It sounds like the banking app you signed up for used facial recognition and head movement verification as part of their identity verification process. This is a common technique used by many mobile banking and financial apps to help confirm the user's identity.

Here's a breakdown of what likely happened:

1. Live Picture: The app requested you to take a live selfie or photo of your face. This allows them to capture an image of your current appearance.

2. Head Movement: The app then asked you to move your head to the right and left. This is to test that you can actively respond to instructions and that the image being captured is of a live person, not just a static photo.

The head movement verification helps ensure that the person signing in is a real, live person and not a photo or video of someone else. By tracking the movement of your head, the app can verify that you are actively participating in the authentication process.

This type of multifactor authentication, combining a photo and head movement, is becoming increasingly common in mobile banking and other security-sensitive apps. It adds an extra layer of identity verification beyond just a username and password.

The goal is to make it harder for someone to impersonate you by requiring this "liveness" check as part of the login process. Overall, it's a security feature designed to protect your account from unauthorized access.

1. **Server-side (Node.js):**

```javascript
const natural = require('natural');

// Define your priority keywords and their corresponding levels
const priorityKeywords = {
  'life-threatening': 'critical',
  'urgent': 'high',
  'emergency': 'high',
  'important': 'medium',
  'critical': 'high',
  'minor': 'low',
};

// Function to analyze the complaint text and assign priority
function analyzePriority(complaintText) {
  const tokenizer = new natural.SentenceTokenizer();
  const sentences = tokenizer.tokenize(complaintText);

  let criticalPriorityCount = 0;
  let highPriorityCount = 0;
  let mediumPriorityCount = 0;
  let lowPriorityCount = 0;

  sentences.forEach((sentence) => {
    for (const keyword in priorityKeywords) {
      if (sentence.toLowerCase().includes(keyword)) {
        const priority = priorityKeywords[keyword];
        switch (priority) {
          case 'critical':
            criticalPriorityCount++;
            break;
          case 'high':
            highPriorityCount++;
            break;
          case 'medium':
            mediumPriorityCount++;
            break;
          case 'low':
            lowPriorityCount++;
            break;
        }
      }
    }
  });

  if (criticalPriorityCount > 0) {
    return 'critical';
  } else if (highPriorityCount > 0) {
    return 'high';
  } else if (mediumPriorityCount > 0) {
    return 'medium';
  } else {
    return 'low';
  }
}
```

2. **Client-side (React):**
   - The client-side implementation would remain similar to the previous example, but you may want to update the user interface to clearly indicate the "critical" priority level for life-threatening situations.
   - You could use different colors, icons, or labels to visually distinguish the critical complaints from other priority levels.
   - Additionally, you may want to implement a mechanism to immediately notify the appropriate authorities or support team when a critical complaint is received.

Here's an example of how you could display the complaints based on their priority:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const ComplaintList = ({ complaints }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Complaints</h2>
      {complaints.map((complaint, index) => (
        <div
          key={index}
          style={{
            backgroundColor:
              complaint.priority === 'critical'
                ? '#ff6b6b'
                : complaint.priority === 'high'
                ? '#ffa500'
                : complaint.priority === 'medium'
                ? '#fff066'
                : '#d0d0d0',
            padding: '1rem',
            marginBottom: '0.5rem',
          }}
        >
          <h3>
            {complaint.priority === 'critical' ? (
              <span style={{ color: 'white' }}>CRITICAL</span>
            ) : complaint.priority === 'high' ? (
              <span style={{ color: 'white' }}>HIGH</span>
            ) : complaint.priority === 'medium' ? (
              'MEDIUM'
            ) : (
              'LOW'
            )}
          </h3>
          <p>{complaint.text}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ComplaintList;
```

In this example, the complaints are displayed with different background colors and labels to visually indicate their priority levels, with the "critical" priority having the highest visual prominence.

Remember to handle the appropriate actions and notifications for critical complaints, such as sending alerts to the support team or emergency services, in addition to displaying them in the user interface.
