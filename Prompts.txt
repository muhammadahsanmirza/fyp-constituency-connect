I have to create an Expanded use Case for each Use Case of  my Project Use Case Diagram 

Expanded Use Case headings will be

Use Case ID:
Use Case Name:
Actors
Description
Trigger
Precondition
Post Condition
Normal Flow:
Alternate Flow
Includes
Special Requirements
Assumptions
Notes and Issues 


A brief description of these headings is

Preconditions:
These should be non-obvious.
Preconditions state what must ALWAYS be true before you can start the scenario.  This often defines the success of another use case.
Success guarantees state what must be true on successful completion of the use case.  


Normal Flow:

This satisfies the interests of the stakeholders.  You get your groceries, the store gets your money, inventory is reduced, etc.
Steps:
An interaction between actors
Validation (by the system)
State change to the system

Normal Flow will be the as The User does action and system responds according to it 

Alternative Flow:
These include all other possible outcomes, both success and failure.

and The most Important Thing 

Write in UI-Free Style
Most programs are dependent upon a particular user interface.  However, avoid constraining your program too early:
For example:
“The user keys an ID and password into a dialog box and presses the OK button.”
“The user identifies himself to the system.”
The latter allows for biometric ID, keyin, etc.

Essential Style:

Focus on the essence, or basic idea, not the details of implementation
Contrast with concrete style

Domain Model


Now We have to create a Domain Model of our system 
The model should identify the set of conceptual classes (The
domain model is iteratively completed.)
It is the basis for the design of the software
It helps us identify, relate and visualize important information.
• Represents real-world concepts, not software components
• Software-oriented class diagrams will be developed later (during
design phase )
However, no operations are defined in domain models
• Only ... 
• domain objects and conceptual classes
• associations between them
• attributes of conceptual classe
• Provides a glossary of terms – noun based

Domain Class
• Domain class consist of class name and attributes
• Domain class does not have methods

Relation
• A line with a label represents the relation between two classes
• A relation has a cardinality constraint

Finding Conceptual Classes
Identify noun phrases in your use-cases
• Identify nouns and phrases in textual descriptions(Success Scenarios of Expanded Use Cases) of a domain ( 
use cases, or other documents)

Below are the use case name along with success Scenario

I have to create diagram of each one of them 

The guidelines for System Sequence Diagram are

A system sequence diagram shows the interaction between an actor  and the system for one use case scenario.
It shows:
The system (as a black box)
The initiating actor
Each external system which sends messages to the system
The messages into and out of the system
The sequence in which the messages occur


System	operations	are	the	operations	that	the	system	as	a  black box component oﬀers in its public interface.

These are high-level operations triggered by an	external input  event / system event generated by an	external actor

During	system	behavior	analysis,	system	operations	are  assigned to a conceptual class System


How to construct an SSD from a use case?
Draw System as black box on right side
For each actor that directly operates on the System, draw a stick  figure and a lifeline.
For each System events that each actor generates in use case, draw a  message.


SSD will follow the success scenario steps of each use case 

Create a separate System Sequence Diagram for each use case
